 *     Purpose: Create Winner class to handle all data regarding the hangman
 *     	game. This class inherits two classes, Player and Word. The class
 *     	uses several character arrays for comparison and contains the actual
 *     	gameplay loop that executes to play and display the game hangman. After
 *     	the game is completed the class destructor is called.
